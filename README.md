# Tachiyomi extensions template

# NOTE
This won't work for the time being, because of the situation tachiyomi is in.
Updates will be provided when the dust settles.

## What is this?

This is a template repository to ease the creation of a repository repo for
[tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/) [extensions](https://tachiyomi.org/extensions/).

It provides some tools for a more modern and developer friendly environment.

## How do I use this?

Go see [The guide](./GUIDE.md) for a step-by-step process.

### Known Issues

- As of now, tachiyomi doesn't allow local IPs to be used as repositories (to test stuff),
  and everything (issues, PRs, Discord) has been locked down.
  That being the case, the tools are already available.
